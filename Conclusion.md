# Autonomous_Control_of_Vehicle_Movement_Detection_in_Railway_Gate

Nearly thousands of  people being injured and /or killed by suburban trains every year. In India, railway gate was manually operated by liver pulling method to open and close the gate. In India, city like Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi will have train is most popular transport for middle class person and there will more railway gate in that place. For that place, our technique will helps to reduce the accident. We are improving technologically in various fields so we liked it to do the whole process automatically which reduce the human efforts and is very easy to operate. This technique helps to reduce the future accident rate occurring in many of the places. Thus in future we can reduce the accident rate to the countable numbers. Automatic railway gate control system is cantered on the idea of reducing human involvement for closing and opening the railway gate which allows and prevents cars and humans from crossing railway tracks. The railway gate is a cause of many deaths and accidents. Hence, automating the gate can bring about a ring of surety to controlling the gates. Human may make errors or mistakes so automating this process will reduce the chances of gate failures. Automation of the closing and opening of the railway gate using the switch circuit reduces the accidents to a greater extend. So this technique is eco-friendly in nature. It will reduce man power in practical.
